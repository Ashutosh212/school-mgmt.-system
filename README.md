# 🎓 SchoolStack – A School Management System

> A Python-based school management platform built with **LLD principles**, **Tkinter GUI**, and **SQLite backend**, designed to manage students and employees efficiently. This project is also a base for experimenting with **LLM/ML integration** in the future.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

SchoolStack is a desktop-based school administration tool that enables basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing student and teacher data. It follows solid **Object-Oriented Design**, encapsulating entities such as `Person`, `Student`, and `Employee`. Data is persistently stored using **SQLite**, and the GUI is built with **Tkinter**.

### Features to add:
- Get in-detailed information student/employee using LLM API
- Use Natural language to add_student/add_employee using NL2SQL model(hugging face)
- Update information about any person
- automatic schedule parent meeting if student perform lesser than average
- send fee remainder main, if fee is due
